    abstract type AbstractConnections

A supertype for all connections between clumps.

Every subtype of `AbstractConnections` should be mutable with a field `connections` which is similar to a vector
of vectors an array-like objectsuch that that `connections[i]` is a list of clump indices that
are connected to clump `i`.

This should be updated in-place during the integration, i.e. it only shows the connections at the current time.

Every subtype of `AbstractConnections` should implement a `form_connections(con::Connections, u)` method which
returns what `con.connections` should be updated with, assuming that `u` is the solution vector. The correction
of indices due to living clumps is provided automatically later, so here it can be assumed that `u` contains
only living clumps.

Any subtype of `AbstractConnections` can be evaluated at an `OrdinaryDiffEq.integrator` for callback purposes.
